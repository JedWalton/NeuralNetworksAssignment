In this report, we will be implementing a deep neural
network with an input layer, three hidden layers with
ReLu non-linear activation and an output or classification
layer. We will be training a neural network to classify
images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. This report documents
the training process investigating the effects of the
following hyperparameter settings on accuracy: Batch
size, Depth, Width, Convolutional filter size, Dropout,
Batchnorm, Max pool, Tanh non-linearity, Optimiser,
Weights initialization, Regularisation (weight decay),
Learning rate, Learning rate scheduler. Further we
explored the number of epochs, momentum and
normalization and noted the model accuracy on 10000 test
images along with final training loss.


Please refer to Github commits for each stage of the development.
